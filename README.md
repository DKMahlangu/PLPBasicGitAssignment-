# PLPBasicGitAssignment
## Task 1: Repository Setup

LoggedIn to github account and created a repository `PLPBasicGitAssignment` and initialized it with a README file.

## Task 2: Local Setup

created a new folder on my local machine `PLPBasicGitAssignment`, then navigated to the folder using GitBash terminal then initialized the repo.

## Task 3: Making Changes

created a `hello.txt` file using Visual Studio Code and added the `Hello,Git` message.

**Steps**
- Open the VS Code
- Go to file > open folder (open the folder that you created on your local machine)
- Inside the folder create a new text file `name.txt`
- Then write your message

#### Commiting changes:
Go to your GitBash terminal and add the following commands
- `git add hello.txt`
- `git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"`

### Task 4: Pushing to GitHub
I used VS code to push the commited changes because GitBash was giving me an error.
